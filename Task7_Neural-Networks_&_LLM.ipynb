By studying how previous models worked, we're making GPT-4 smarter and more useful. With GPT-4, we're aiming to create a computer buddy that can help us with all sorts of tasks, from answering questions to writing stories, while making sure it's fair and reliable. This progress shows how far we've come in making computers more like us in how they understand and use language, opening up exciting possibilities for the future."
